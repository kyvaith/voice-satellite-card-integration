/**
 * Chime Utility
 *
 * Plays pre-rendered sound files from /voice_satellite/sounds/.
 * Each chime is pre-cached as an Audio element on first use for
 * instant playback with no synthesis overhead.
 *
 * Routing rules when TTS output is a remote media_player:
 *   - Announcement mode (default): chime fires on the remote via
 *     media_player.play_media with announce=true, matching the TTS
 *     path so both ride the speaker's announce-mode handling.
 *   - Normal Playback mode: chime also fires on the remote, but with
 *     announce=false. TtsManager.playChime captures a snapshot of the
 *     remote BEFORE this fires and schedules a deferred restore that
 *     runs after the last activity in the interaction (typically the
 *     done chime), so the user's prior music can be resumed even on
 *     speakers that don't honor the announce flag.

/** Chime definitions.
 *
 *  Only the URL is canonical.  The `duration` field is a conservative
 *  fallback used before the browser has loaded the MP3's metadata -
 *  callers that schedule a post-chime unmute should prefer
 *  `getChimeDuration(chime)` which returns the real file length read
 *  off the cached Audio element's `duration` property.
 *
 *  Why it matters: users can drop their own chime files into
 *  `/config/voice_satellite/sounds/` and the integration (see
 *  `_sync_custom_sounds()` in __init__.py) copies them over the
 *  built-in ones at startup.  Those custom files can be any length.
 *  A hardcoded duration would under-declare them, re-arming the mic
 *  mid-chime and bleeding audio into STT.
